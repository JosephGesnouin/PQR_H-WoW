# About PQR
PQR is a bot designed to perform complex DPS, healing and tanking rotations for the player. It was mainly designed to reduce the tediousness of performing a complex rotation for hours on end, which for many can be a huge relief and provide them with a better WoW experience where they may have wanted to quit in other cases.
<br>
<br>• No addons to configure.
<br>• No pixel scanning to hinder performance.
<br>• Easily customizable and shareable abilities and rotations.
